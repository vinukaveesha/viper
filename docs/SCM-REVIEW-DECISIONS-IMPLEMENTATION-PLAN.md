# SCM review decisions — implementation plan

This document is for **developers**: what exists today for `SCM_REVIEW_DECISION_*`, where it lives, and the **planned work** to re-evaluate approve vs needs-work when review threads change without a full agent run. User-facing merge semantics stay in [SCM review decisions and merge blocking](SCM-REVIEW-DECISIONS-AND-MERGE-BLOCKING.md).

Follow **single responsibility**, established patterns, and **reuse** shared infrastructure (config, model factory, logging) without merging unrelated prompts or tools into one agent.

---

## 1. Baseline: runner and config (done)

| Area | Location |
|------|----------|
| Env / CLI | `SCMConfig` in `src/code_review/config.py`; `review` in `src/code_review/__main__.py` |
| Threshold logic | `_compute_review_decision_from_counts` in `src/code_review/runner.py` |
| Aggregated counts | `_quality_gate_high_medium_counts` → `provider.get_unresolved_review_items_for_quality_gate` + `to_post` findings |
| Submit | `_maybe_submit_review_decision` (checks `review_decision_enabled`, `capabilities().supports_review_decisions`, `dry_run`) |
| Call site | End of `_post_findings_and_summary` in `src/code_review/runner.py` (after inline posts + optional omit-marker summary) |
| Tests | `tests/test_runner.py` (`test_run_review_*review_decision*` mocks) |

Adding a **new** SCM still means: implement `submit_review_decision`, set `supports_review_decisions=True` where applicable, implement or inherit `get_unresolved_review_items_for_quality_gate`, add tests.

---

## 2. Baseline: interface (done)

| Item | Location |
|------|----------|
| `ReviewDecision` | `Literal["APPROVE", "REQUEST_CHANGES"]` in `src/code_review/providers/base.py` |
| `submit_review_decision(...)` | Default raises `NotImplementedError`; GitHub, Gitea, GitLab, Bitbucket Cloud, Bitbucket Server (conditional) override |
| `ProviderCapabilities.supports_review_decisions` | `True` only where submission is implemented (Bitbucket Server only when user slug configured) |
| `get_unresolved_review_items_for_quality_gate` | Default uses `get_existing_review_comments`; overrides for thread/task semantics |

---

## 3. Baseline: per-provider behavior (done)

| Provider | Submission | Quality gate (open high/medium signals) |
|----------|------------|----------------------------------------|
| **GitHub** | `POST .../pulls/{id}/reviews` | GraphQL `reviewThreads`: unresolved **and** non-outdated; GraphQL failure → `[]` (counts rely on this run’s `to_post` only) |
| **Gitea** | GitHub-style; soft-fail if unsupported | Default path from `get_existing_review_comments` / `resolved` when API exposes it — **no** GraphQL thread/outdated model in-repo |
| **GitLab** | `POST .../approve`; `REQUEST_CHANGES` clears approve then MR note + `/submit_review requested_changes` | MR discussions with `resolved: false` |
| **Bitbucket Cloud** | approve / request-changes + DELETE opposite state first | **Partial** — open PR tasks (see README table) |
| **Bitbucket Server** | `PUT .../participants/{slug}` when `SCM_BITBUCKET_SERVER_USER_SLUG` set | Activities + open tasks |

Tests: `tests/providers/test_github.py`, `test_gitea.py`, `test_gitlab.py`, `test_bitbucket.py`, `test_bitbucket_server.py`, `test_review_decision_common.py`.

## 4. Problem: transitions back to APPROVE without a new push

Today, `_quality_gate_high_medium_counts` and `_maybe_submit_review_decision` run only at the **end of a full review** (after the agent and posting). That is sufficient when authors **push** (new `head_sha`, Jenkins/GitHub Actions typically fire again): GitHub already excludes **outdated** threads; resolved discussions and deleted comments disappear from APIs on the next fetch.

Gaps:

1. **Triggers** — Bundled Jenkins allows PR actions such as `opened` / `reopened` / `synchronize` (and Bitbucket `pr:*`), not **comment-only** events. If someone **deletes** a comment, **resolves** a thread, or **replies** without pushing, the full runner does not run, so the bot may stay on REQUEST_CHANGES / needs-work even when counts would now pass.
2. **“Replied to”** — Not implemented yet; **planned:** LLM classification of replies that dispute/dismiss the finding (see §5.1, Phase D). Until then, unresolved threads with replies still count unless resolved or outdated.
3. **Optimization** — There is no API-backed check that the bot is **currently blocking** the PR before doing expensive or noisy work; the user requirement is to **only** recompute when the PR is already in rejected / needs-work (from the bot’s perspective).

---

## 5. Product decisions

### 5.1 “Replied to” — LLM classification (target behavior)

For threads that still appear **open** in the SCM (unresolved, non-outdated) but have **user replies** after the review comment, we do **not** rely on simple heuristics (e.g. “any reply”). Instead:

1. **Inputs** — For each candidate thread, pass the **original review text** (and severity if known, e.g. `[High]` / `[Medium]`) plus the **reply body to classify**. **Who may reply:** any **human** collaborator on the PR is in scope (a full team may have worked on the branch; do not restrict to PR author only). **Which reply:** use the **latest non-bot** note on the thread. In the common case, a **comment webhook fires once per new reply**, so the payload identifies the new comment — treat that as the reply under classification (it is the latest human addition). For batch or scheduled runs without a specific event, fetch the thread and take the **latest non-bot** comment after the bot’s finding.
2. **LLM task** — Classify whether the user is **disputing or dismissing** the finding in a way that should **stop counting** it toward the merge gate. Examples of intents that support **agreed** (non-exhaustive): *feature not a bug*, *won’t fix*, *acceptable risk / ignorable for now*, *false positive / you got this wrong*, *out of scope for this PR*.

3. **Structured output (contract)** — The model returns JSON only, with this shape:

   ```json
   {
     "verdict": "agreed" | "disagreed",
     "reply_text": "<string, required when verdict is disagreed>"
   }
   ```

   - **`agreed`** — We accept the user’s explanation; the finding **does not** count toward open high/medium for that thread (**reduce outstanding by one** for gate purposes, same as excluding the thread from aggregation).
   - **`disagreed`** — We do **not** accept the dismissal; the thread **still** counts. The response **must** include **`reply_text`**: the **text of the reply to the user’s comment** (i.e. the message we pass back for the bot to post on the thread so the user knows the gate still applies and why). When `verdict` is `agreed`, `reply_text` is omitted (or empty).

4. **Effect in the runner** — On `agreed`, apply the count reduction / exclusion. On `disagreed`, use `reply_text` as the body for a follow-up SCM comment (exact posting behavior TBD: always post vs dry-run log only).

5. **Bot noise** — Do not treat comments authored by the **automation / bot** identity as a dismissal attempt; skip classification (or no-op) for those events.

6. **Idempotency / caching** — Treated by the rest of the design rather than a separate store: comment webhooks identify a **specific comment**; after classification we **recompute the gate from SCM state** (threads, counts) and may **re-submit** the same review decision if nothing changed — which is harmless. Redelivery may repeat an LLM call; avoiding that is an **optional optimization**, not required for correctness.

7. **Safety / prompt stance** — Keep prompts **pragmatic**, not aggressive. Teams may have **legitimate reasons** to clear the gate quickly (deadlines, risk acceptance, follow-up tickets). Let the model judge `agreed` vs `disagreed` on the merits of the reply; do not bake in heavy anti-gaming or “must be substantive” barriers unless product explicitly tightens later.

### 5.2 When to skip work

Exact rule for “only if blocking”: query bot review/participant state vs always recompute when `UNKNOWN` (see Phase C).

### 5.3 Agent boundaries — two agents

Use **two separate agents** (separate ADK `Agent` definitions / instruction surfaces, or equivalent isolated invocations). Do **not** extend the code-review agent with reply-dismissal instructions or merge-gate JSON.

| | **Code review agent** (existing) | **Reply-dismissal agent** (new) |
|---|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Responsibility** | Discover issues on the diff; output structured **findings** for posting. | Judge one **user reply** against one **prior review comment**; output **verdict** JSON per §5.1. |
| **Inputs** | Diff, file content, standards context, optional context brief. | Original comment body (+ severity if known), reply body; no full diff. |
| **Tools** | SCM tools (or single-shot mode without tools per runner). | **None** — all context is passed in the prompt (runner/provider assemble the thread slice). |
| **Output contract** | JSON array of `FindingV1` (parsed by runner). | Verdict JSON per §5.1 (`agreed` / `disagreed`, `reply_text` when needed); validate with Pydantic. |
| **Location (planned)** | `src/code_review/agent/agent.py` (`create_review_agent`, …). | New module e.g. `src/code_review/agent/reply_dismissal_agent.py` with `create_reply_dismissal_agent(...)` (exact name TBD). |
| **Model config** | `LLM_*` via `get_configured_model()` etc. | **Same default** `LLM_*` unless we add optional overrides (e.g. `LLM_REPLY_DISMISSAL_MODEL`) later. |

**Orchestration:** `runner` (or a thin coordinator) decides **which** agent runs: full review path → code review agent only; comment-webhook / review-decision path that needs dismissal classification → reply-dismissal agent, then gate math and `submit_review_decision`. No agent calls the other.

**Reuse:** Shared **model wiring** (`models.py`, config), **logging**, and **JSON extraction** helpers where sensible; do **not** share one system prompt or one tool list across both.

---

## 6. Technical plan (phased)

### Phase A — Review-decision-only mode (runner + CLI)

- Add a mode (CLI flag and/or env, e.g. `--review-decision-only` / `CODE_REVIEW_REVIEW_DECISION_ONLY`) that:
  - Skips the **code review agent** (no full diff review / findings JSON).
  - May still invoke the **reply-dismissal agent** (§5.3) when Phase D classification is enabled for that run.
  - Reuses `_quality_gate_high_medium_counts` (after any reply-based exclusions) and `_maybe_submit_review_decision` with `to_post=[]` unless we also surface net-new findings in some hybrid flow.
- Refactor if needed so decision submission is not duplicated between the full path and this path.
- `head_sha` handling: keep consistent with existing `submit_review_decision` per provider (GitHub/Gitea/GitLab use it in places).

**Tests:** `MockProvider`: counts → `APPROVE` / `REQUEST_CHANGES`; patch reply-dismissal agent when testing Phase D integration.

### Phase B — SCM triggers for non-push activity

- Document and optionally wire **webhooks** / CI filters so comment and discussion events can invoke Phase A:
  - **GitHub:** e.g. `pull_request_review_comment`, `issue_comment`, optionally `pull_request_review`.
  - **GitLab:** note / MR discussion events as appropriate.
  - **Bitbucket:** comment / task events per API.
- **One event per new comment** is typical: each delivery can drive **one** classification for the **comment id in the payload**, without scanning the whole thread for “what changed” on that run. Full runs without a comment event still use **latest non-bot** on the thread (see §5.1).
- Update Jenkins / GitHub Actions docs with example filters; keep existing synchronize behavior for full reviews.

### Phase C — “Only if bot is blocking” (optional provider API)

- Add something like `get_bot_blocking_review_state(...) -> BLOCKING | NOT_BLOCKING | UNKNOWN` (names TBD) on `ProviderInterface` with defaults:
  - **GitHub / Gitea:** infer from latest review by the bot user for this PR.
  - **GitLab:** approval + requested-changes / review state (version-dependent).
  - **Bitbucket Cloud:** request-changes vs approved for the bot.
  - **Bitbucket Server:** participant `NEEDS_WORK` vs `APPROVED` for `SCM_BITBUCKET_SERVER_USER_SLUG`.
- In review-decision-only mode: if **NOT_BLOCKING** and there are no new high/medium findings to post, **skip** unresolved aggregation and submission (per product confirmation). If **UNKNOWN**, prefer safe default (recompute) unless documented otherwise.

### Phase D — Reply threads + LLM dismissal (per provider + model)

1. **Data** — Extend thread/discussion fetching so we can pair **bot/review comment body** with **subsequent human replies** and author metadata:
   - **GitHub:** GraphQL: comment list per thread with `author`, `createdAt`, body; identify bot vs human via login/app id (config: bot user id or pattern).
   - **GitLab:** MR discussion `notes` ordered; filter by author and bot note detection.
   - **Bitbucket Server / Cloud:** activity / note payloads where threading exists; Cloud may stay tasks-first until inline threads are rich enough.
   - **Gitea:** confirm API; document gaps.

2. **Gate integration** — On a **comment webhook**, map the payload to a thread + **that** new reply and run the **reply-dismissal agent** once (§5.3). On a **batch path**, same agent per thread that needs classification. Return **structured JSON** per §5.1 (`verdict`, `reply_text` when `disagreed`).
   - If **`agreed`**, **omit that thread** from the high/medium dedupe set (one thread → at most one gate bump today).
   - If **`disagreed`**, keep the thread in counts and surface **`reply_text`** to the layer that posts SCM comments (or logs in dry-run).

3. **Config** — Env flags e.g. enable reply classification, max threads per run, model override optional; tie to `LLM_*` credentials already used by the runner.

4. **Operational** — Log `verdict` for audit; cap LLM calls per webhook; dry-run: log `reply_text` instead of posting where applicable; then recompute gate / `submit_review_decision` as today.

### Phase E — Docs and observability

- Extend [SCM-REVIEW-DECISIONS-AND-MERGE-BLOCKING.md](SCM-REVIEW-DECISIONS-AND-MERGE-BLOCKING.md) for the new flow.
- Log clearly when a run is review-decision-only vs full; when submission is skipped due to “not blocking.”

## 8. Optional follow-ups (unchanged from earlier notes)

- Extend `ReviewDecision` or capabilities if an SCM needs a third native state beyond approve / request-changes.
- **Bitbucket Cloud quality gate:** enrich from inline comments if the API exposes resolution reliably.
- Heavy live SCM integration tests (high maintenance).
