# Jenkins: review-decision-only on comment activity

Use this guide when you already have the normal Jenkins PR review pipeline working and want comment or thread activity to recompute the quality gate without running the full review agent.

This guide assumes the base Jenkins setup already exists:

- [Jenkins (existing)](JENKINS-EXISTING.md) for Gitea, GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket Cloud
- [Bitbucket Data Center](BITBUCKET-DATACENTER.md) for Bitbucket Server / DC

---

## Overview

There are two supported Jenkins setups:

- **Recommended:** create a second pipeline job dedicated to comment and thread events
- **Alternative:** reuse the existing pipeline job and switch selected webhook actions to review-decision-only

Both approaches use the same bundled Jenkinsfile: `docker/jenkins/Jenkinsfile`.

---

## 1. Recommended: create a second pipeline job

### 1.1 Create the job

Keep both jobs in the same folder.

1. On the full-review job, make sure `SCM_REVIEW_DECISION_ENABLED=true` is already enabled.
2. Start from that working full-review pipeline job.
3. Use **New Item** → **Copy from** to create a second job, for example `code-review-comments`.
4. Keep both jobs in the same folder so they share the folder-level configuration.

Important:

- If the copied job seems to lose `SCM_PROVIDER` or `SCM_URL` after runs, move those values to the folder-level environment configuration (preferred for multi-SCM), or set them directly on each Bitbucket job, instead of relying on job parameter defaults.
- With **Pipeline script from SCM**, Jenkins can reapply parameter definitions from `docker/jenkins/Jenkinsfile`, so job parameter default values may appear reset.

### 1.2 Enable review decisions on the new job

On the copied job, set:

- `SCM_REVIEW_DECISION_ENABLED=true` so the gate decision is submitted

Optional:

- `CODE_REVIEW_REPLY_DISMISSAL_ENABLED=false` if you want to disable reply-dismissal on `reply_added`
- `CODE_REVIEW_REVIEW_DECISION_ONLY_SKIP_IF_BOT_NOT_BLOCKING=true` to skip reply-driven runs when the bot is not currently blocking
- `CODE_REVIEW_BOT_USER_LOGIN` and/or `CODE_REVIEW_BOT_USER_ID` if you want Jenkins itself to skip webhook builds caused by Viper's own comments before the agent starts
- `SCM_REVIEW_DECISION_HIGH_THRESHOLD` and `SCM_REVIEW_DECISION_MEDIUM_THRESHOLD` as needed
- `SCM_BITBUCKET_SERVER_USER_SLUG` for Bitbucket Server / DC

For Bitbucket Server / DC, the bundled Jenkinsfile already uses `SCM_BITBUCKET_SERVER_USER_SLUG` as the fallback bot login for that skip check, so `CODE_REVIEW_BOT_USER_LOGIN` is mainly needed for other SCMs or when you prefer matching by a different login.

See the [Configuration reference](CONFIGURATION-REFERENCE.md) for definitions and provider-specific notes.

No additional routing configuration is needed: the Jenkinsfile automatically detects comment and thread events from `PR_ACTION` and routes them to `--review-decision-only`.

For Bitbucket Server / DC, use a GWT webhook filter on the comment-events job so only `pr:comment:*` events trigger it (for example `^pr:comment:(added|deleted)$`). The full-review job handles `pr:opened`, `pr:modified`, and `pr:from_ref_updated`.

### 1.3 Configure the copied job webhook

On the copied job:

1. Keep the same core PR mappings as the full-review job: `SCM_OWNER`, `SCM_REPO`, `SCM_PR_NUM`, and `SCM_HEAD_SHA` when available.
2. Map `PR_ACTION` from the event field used by your SCM.
3. Add the optional `CODE_REVIEW_EVENT_*` mappings below.
4. Filter the webhook so only comment or thread events trigger this job.

`SCM_HEAD_SHA` may be empty for review-decision-only runs. The runner can resolve the current PR head from the SCM API when needed.

### 1.3.1 Optional filter setup (Generic Webhook Trigger)

In **Generic Webhook Trigger** for the copied comment-events job, configure:

- **Optional filter** -> **Text**: `$PR_ACTION`
- **Optional filter** -> **Regex**: use a regex that matches only comment/thread actions for your SCM mapping

Concrete examples:

- Gitea/GitHub when `PR_ACTION=$.action` and you only want comment creates/deletes:
  - Regex: `^(created|deleted)$`
- GitLab note hooks when `PR_ACTION=$.object_attributes.action`:
  - Regex: `^(create|update)$`
- GitHub when `PR_ACTION` is event name (for example `issue_comment` or `pull_request_review_comment`):
  - Regex: `^(issue_comment|pull_request_review_comment)$`
- Bitbucket Server / DC when `PR_ACTION=$.eventKey`:
  - Regex: `^pr:comment:(added|edited|deleted)$`
  - Or only new comments/replies: `^pr:comment:added$`

For the full-review job, keep the PR lifecycle filter instead (for Bitbucket Server / DC, for example `^pr:(opened|modified|from_ref_updated)$`).

### 1.4 Map review-decision event context

Add these Generic Webhook Trigger **Post content parameters** to the comment-events job. `CODE_REVIEW_EVENT_COMMENT_ID` is required for reply-dismissal; the others are used by the bot-reply guard.

| Variable | GitHub (`issue_comment` / `pull_request_review_comment`) | GitLab (note hook) | Bitbucket Cloud (`pullrequest:comment_created`) | Bitbucket Server / DC (`pr:comment:added`) |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `CODE_REVIEW_EVENT_COMMENT_ID` | `$.comment.id` | `$.object_attributes.id` | `$.comment.id` | `$.comment.id` |
| `CODE_REVIEW_EVENT_ACTOR_LOGIN` | `$.sender.login` | `$.user.username` | `$.actor.nickname` | `$.actor.slug` |
| `CODE_REVIEW_EVENT_ACTOR_ID` | `$.sender.id` | `$.user.id` | `$.actor.uuid` | `$.actor.id` |



See [Configuration reference](CONFIGURATION-REFERENCE.md#51-review-decision-webhook-context-code_review_event_) for the variable definitions.

When Jenkins also knows the bot identity (`CODE_REVIEW_BOT_USER_LOGIN`, `CODE_REVIEW_BOT_USER_ID`, or `SCM_BITBUCKET_SERVER_USER_SLUG` on Bitbucket Server / DC), the bundled Jenkinsfile skips those bot-authored comment/thread events before it launches the agent. The runner still keeps its own SCM-backed bot guard as a fallback.

### 1.5 Point comment webhooks to the second job

Keep the existing full-review webhook pointed at the original job. Point comment or thread events at the copied job.

Use these base guides for the SCM-specific webhook shape:

- [Jenkins (existing)](JENKINS-EXISTING.md) for Gitea, GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket Cloud
- [Bitbucket Data Center](BITBUCKET-DATACENTER.md) for Bitbucket Server / DC

### 1.6 Validate the setup

Trigger a comment or reply event on a test PR and confirm:

- the comment-events job runs
- the logs show `--review-decision-only`
- the job recomputes the quality gate without posting normal inline findings

Trigger a bot-authored follow-up comment (for example a Viper reply-dismissal reply) and confirm the build is skipped early with a message about a bot-authored comment or thread event.

If you need a non-posting check first, run `code-review --review-decision-only --dry-run` manually outside Jenkins with the same environment.

---

## 2. Alternative: reuse the existing Jenkins job

If you do not want a second job, the existing Jenkins job can handle both full reviews and comment-driven recalculation.

### 2.1 Update the existing job

1. Keep the current Jenkinsfile: `docker/jenkins/Jenkinsfile`.
2. Set `SCM_REVIEW_DECISION_ENABLED=true`.
3. Add the optional `CODE_REVIEW_EVENT_*` webhook mappings if you want structured logs or reply-dismissal.
4. Optionally set `CODE_REVIEW_REPLY_DISMISSAL_ENABLED=false` if you want to disable reply-dismissal.

No additional routing configuration is needed. The Jenkinsfile automatically routes comment/thread events (detected from `PR_ACTION`) to `--review-decision-only` and PR lifecycle events to a full review.

### 2.2 Expand the webhook mapping

Update the existing Generic Webhook Trigger so it can accept both:

- normal PR actions that should run the full review
- comment or thread actions that should run review-decision-only

The Jenkinsfile automatically decides which mode to run based on `PR_ACTION`; no extra configuration is needed to indicate which actions are comment events.

### 2.3 Know the tradeoff

This setup is simpler, but full reviews and comment-only recalculation share the same queue, logs, and build counts.
