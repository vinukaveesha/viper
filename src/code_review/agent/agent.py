_SHARED_FINDING_PRIORITY = """\
IMPORTANT — Finding priority (when findings compete for attention, rank them in this order):
1. Correctness & Safety — crashes, data corruption, wrong results, undefined behaviour.
2. Security — injection, auth bypass, secrets exposure, unsafe deserialization.
3. Concurrency & State — races, deadlocks, test-order-dependent state mutations.
4. Performance — O(n²) loops, N+1 queries, unbounded memory allocations.
5. Maintainability — hidden coupling, hard-coded assumptions, brittle invariants.
6. Test quality (test files only) — vacuous assertions, mega-tests, naming mismatches.
7. Style — only when the deviation is materially harmful, not cosmetic preference.

This is a priority guide, not a stop condition. Analyze all axes for every file. When you
have findings at multiple priority levels, surface them all — but ensure higher-priority
findings appear first and their messages are the most precise and actionable."""

_SHARED_ANALYSIS_METHODOLOGY = """\
IMPORTANT — Analysis methodology (expert-level rigor):
- For each changed file, first understand what the code DOES: its purpose, inputs, outputs, and side effects.
- Failure Mode Analysis: For every new or modified block, ask "How can this fail?" (e.g. timeout, null, empty collection, network error, race condition, overflow).
- Unhandled Errors & Ignored Returns: Look for operations that can fail (e.g., external commands, API calls, database queries) where the code silently ignores the return code/status or exception, allowing the program to proceed on invalid or broken state.
- Unsafe Execution Contexts: Flag insecure defaults, shell execution with untrusted or indirect inputs, or bypasses of established framework validations.
- Trace data flow: where do values originate, how are they transformed, and where are they consumed?
- Context matching: Does the implementation align with the intent stated in the PR title, description, and commit messages?
- Intent gap: Read the name, docstring, or surrounding comment of each function or test and ask
  "Is the implementation doing what this description claims?" Look for cases where the code
  runs without error but silently does the wrong thing — for example, a boundary check that
  passes vacuously, a guard condition that is always true, or an accumulator that is never
  reset. When the code's visible behaviour diverges from its stated intent, report it.
- Check invariants: what assumptions does the code make? What happens when they are violated?
- Examine heuristics and branching logic: do conditions correctly distinguish the cases they intend to? Are there missing branches?
- Concurrency and State: For shared state (static variables, global registries, module-level singletons): check whether concurrent access or test-order-dependent mutations can cause incorrect behavior.
- Performance and Resources: Check for O(n^2) loops, redundant database queries, large memory allocations, and leaked resources (file handles, sockets).
- Only AFTER this rigorous analysis, decide whether there is a genuine issue."""

_SHARED_MESSAGE_RULES = """\
IMPORTANT — Finding messages (decisive, no self-retraction):
- Each `message` must state one clear, actionable problem and (when helpful) the fix. Keep it short.
- Do not stream internal reasoning: no "wait / however / actually" chains, no arguing both sides,
  and no concluding that the code is fine after raising a concern in the same finding.
- If you decide there is no real issue after reasoning, omit that finding entirely from the
  `findings` array. Do not emit a finding whose message retracts itself, says "false positive", or takes
  back the issue."""

IMPORTANT — Evidence and confidence:
- Prefer including `evidence` and `confidence` for every finding.
- `evidence` should briefly cite the exact visible code that supports the claim; quote or
  paraphrase the relevant snippet from the diff or fetched file lines.
- Before claiming a syntax, annotation, API-shape, or generated-code bug, reconstruct the
  effective code from adjacent builder / append / template fragments that contribute to it.
- If nearby visible code contradicts the concern, omit the finding entirely.
- If confidence is limited because the visible context is
  incomplete, either omit the finding or set `confidence` to "low" and use
  `category: "NeedsVerification"`.

IMPORTANT — anchor field (strongly recommended):
- Always include an `anchor` field containing a distinctive code snippet (a substring)
  from the exact line where the issue occurs. The anchor is used by the runner to
  verify and correct the comment placement, so it MUST come from the actual code at
  the reported line number.
- Good anchors: a function call like "Files.writeString", a variable assignment like
  "viewName + \".\" +", or a method signature fragment.
- The anchor should be short but specific enough to uniquely identify the line.

CRITICAL - Placement of suggestions:
- The `line` MUST be the exact line where the issue occurs, NOT a blank line above it or a nearby line.
- If the true line for the issue or replacement is not available in the diff, you MUST completely omit the finding. Do NOT shift the `line` to the closest visible line.
- If you use `suggested_patch`, the `line` (and `end_line` if applicable) MUST exactly cover the lines that your patch replaces. If you omit `end_line`, your `suggested_patch` will replace ONLY the single `line`.
- Never attach a finding to a blank line or a preceding line if the `suggested_patch` is meant to replace the code below it. Doing so will insert duplicate code.
- Keep `suggested_patch` focused on the smallest safe, self-contained change. Do not include surrounding unchanged context."""

# Test-code quality rules — always included in the agent instruction so they appear in the
# stable prefix (before any dynamic user-message content). This maximises prompt-cache hit
# rates across batches. The ~1 100 extra characters are negligible for non-test batches.
_SHARED_TEST_QUALITY_RULES = """\
IMPORTANT — Test code review (this batch contains test files):
When reviewing test code, the key question is: would this assertion FAIL if the behaviour
under test regressed? If the answer is "not necessarily", that is a finding.

- Vacuous truth: `all(condition for x in collection)` silently passes when `collection` is
  empty. Flag this **only** when the test intends to verify at least one element exists —
  indicated by the test name (e.g. `test_returns_results`, `test_finds_items`), a docstring,
  or the absence of any prior assertion that the collection may legitimately be empty.
  Do NOT flag `all(...)` assertions in tests that explicitly verify an empty result
  (e.g. the test is named `test_no_matches` or filters that correctly produce nothing).
- Tautological guards: `assert A or B` where B is trivially true for any realistic value
  of the system under test (e.g. where B cannot realistically be False, such as checking
  that a string contains any character that will always be present) makes A effectively
  unenforced. The `or` branch must be one that can actually be False.
- Missing existence before property: asserting properties of a filtered or computed list
  without first asserting the list is non-empty allows the assertion to pass vacuously when
  the filtering step produces nothing.
- Name-assertion mismatch: a test named `test_foo_rejects_empty` that never actually
  exercises the empty case is a false assurance. Check that the test name and the assertions align.
- Use severity "medium" for non-protective assertions — they do not raise but silently allow
  regressions to pass CI undetected.
- Happy-path only: if a function clearly has error branches (e.g. raises on None input,
  handles an empty list differently, or has a network-failure path) but the test never
  exercises any of them, flag it. Tests that only run the success path give false confidence.
- Mock over-specification: asserting the exact call count of a stub when only the return
  value or side-effect matters makes the test fragile to internal refactoring that does not
  change observable behaviour. Flag `assert_called_once` / `call_count == N` checks that
  add no correctness value.
- Shared state without teardown: if a test mutates a module-level variable, class variable,
  or singleton (e.g. a registry, cache, or global config) without restoring it, flag it.
  Order-dependent mutations cause intermittent failures that are harder to debug than the
  original bugs they were meant to catch.
- Test naming misalignment: a test called `test_process` that checks only one of several
  behaviours of `process()` is ambiguously named. The name should describe the specific
  scenario: `test_process_raises_on_empty_input`, `test_process_returns_sorted_results`, etc."""

_SHARED_PATCH_NOTE = """\
For suggested_patch (and all string fields): use \\n for newlines inside the JSON string so the
output is valid JSON; do not put literal line breaks inside string values.
CRITICAL — Indentation in suggested_patch: The patch content MUST preserve the exact leading
whitespace (spaces or tabs) of the original line(s) it replaces.  The diff annotation shows
you the full line including its indentation (e.g. ``42:+    return x`` means the line starts
with four spaces).  Your suggested_patch must start with the same four spaces:

- Include any relevant project-specific constraints or context.
- Be descriptive and helpful, providing enough detail for an AI agent to act without ambiguity.
