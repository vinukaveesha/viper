# Shared instruction fragments
# Both TOOL_ENABLED_REVIEW_INSTRUCTION (tool-enabled review) and
# EMBEDDED_DIFF_REVIEW_INSTRUCTION (tool-free embedded-diff review, now used by prepared
# batch sub-agents) share the same output-format contract, finding schema,
# anchor/placement rules, and examples. Edit these fragments to update both

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The three bullet-point rules shared by both instructions in the
# "IMPORTANT — Line numbers" section (the intro sentence differs per mode).
_SHARED_LINE_NUMBER_RULES = """\
- Each added/context line is annotated ``<Ln>`` where ``n`` is an integer (e.g. ``<L42>``).
  Use that integer ``n`` as the ``line`` value (e.g. 42) in your findings.
  Do NOT emit the ``<Ln>`` tag itself as the line value; extract only the number.
  Do NOT compute line numbers yourself from the hunk headers.
- Only report findings for lines that have a ``<Ln>`` annotation (added ``+``
  or context `` `` lines). Never report a finding for a removed ``-`` line.
- If the exact line containing the issue has no ``<Ln>`` annotation, drop the
  finding entirely. Do NOT shift it to the nearest annotated line."""

# Output format + finding schema + anchor + placement rules.
_SHARED_FORMAT_AND_PLACEMENT = """\
CRITICAL — Output format: Your final response must be a valid JSON object matching this schema:
- Top-level object: {"findings": [ ... ]}
- If you find one or more issues: put finding objects inside the `findings` array.
- If you find zero issues: output exactly {"findings": []}.
- Do not respond with only prose (e.g. "I found no issues"); always return the JSON object so it can be parsed.

- Each finding must have: path (str), line (int), severity ("high"|"medium"|"low"|"nit"),
code (str, e.g. unused-var), and message (str).
Optional fields: end_line, category (e.g. "Correctness", "Security", "Performance",
"Maintainability", "Tests", "Style"), confidence ("high"|"medium"|"low"), evidence,
anchor, fingerprint_hint.

CRITICAL - Fix guidance fields:
- suggested_patch: Optional but highly recommended for fixable issues.
- agent_fix_prompt: Whenever a patch is provided or a fix is identified, you MUST include a concise but complete natural-language prompt that a downstream AI coding agent can use to implement the fix.

IMPORTANT — Finding messages (decisive, no self-retraction):
- Each `message` must state one clear, actionable problem and (when helpful) the fix. Keep it short.
- Do not stream internal reasoning: no "wait / however / actually" chains, no arguing both sides,
  and no concluding that the code is fine after raising a concern in the same finding.
- If you decide there is no real issue after reasoning, omit that finding entirely from the
  `findings` array. Do not emit a finding whose message retracts itself, says "false positive", or takes
  back the issue.

IMPORTANT — Evidence and confidence:
- Prefer including `evidence` and `confidence` for every finding.
- `evidence` should briefly cite the exact visible code that supports the claim; quote or
  paraphrase the relevant snippet from the diff or fetched file lines.
- Before claiming a syntax, annotation, API-shape, or generated-code bug, reconstruct the
  effective code from adjacent builder / append / template fragments that contribute to it.
- If nearby visible code contradicts the concern, omit the finding entirely.
- Prefer omission over weak speculation. If confidence is limited because the visible context is
  incomplete, either omit the finding or set `confidence` to "low" and use
  `category: "NeedsVerification"`.

IMPORTANT — anchor field (strongly recommended):
- Always include an `anchor` field containing a distinctive code snippet (a substring)
  from the exact line where the issue occurs. The anchor is used by the runner to
  verify and correct the comment placement, so it MUST come from the actual code at
  the reported line number.
- Good anchors: a function call like "Files.writeString", a variable assignment like
  "viewName + \".\" +", or a method signature fragment.
- The anchor should be short but specific enough to uniquely identify the line.

CRITICAL - Placement of suggestions:
- The `line` MUST be the exact line where the issue occurs, NOT a blank line above it or a nearby line.
- If the true line for the issue or replacement is not available in the diff, you MUST completely omit the finding. Do NOT shift the `line` to the closest visible line.
- If you use `suggested_patch`, the `line` (and `end_line` if applicable) MUST exactly cover the lines that your patch replaces. If you omit `end_line`, your `suggested_patch` will replace ONLY the single `line`.
- Never attach a finding to a blank line or a preceding line if the `suggested_patch` is meant to replace the code below it. Doing so will insert duplicate code.
- Keep `suggested_patch` focused on the smallest safe, self-contained change. Do not include surrounding unchanged context."""

# Patch-note line (first sentence identical in both; FINDINGS_ONLY appends one extra).
_SHARED_PATCH_NOTE = """\
For suggested_patch (and all string fields): use \\n for newlines inside the JSON string so the
output is valid JSON; do not put literal line breaks inside string values."""

# agent_fix_prompt guidance + output examples — identical in both modes.
_SHARED_AGENT_FIX_AND_EXAMPLES = """\
agent_fix_prompt: Inclusion is MANDATORY whenever you provide a `suggested_patch` or identify
a specific fix. It provides the necessary context for another AI agent to implement the fix.
Your agent_fix_prompt must:
- Mention the file path and line(s).
- Explicitly describe the problem and provide a detailed instruction for the fix.
- Include any relevant project-specific constraints or context.

Example (one finding with fix): {
  "findings": [
    {
      "path": "src/foo.py",
      "line": 42,
      "severity": "medium",
      "code": "rename-variable",
      "category": "Maintainability",
      "confidence": "high",

      "anchor": "foo = request.user_id",
      "suggested_patch": "user_id = request.user_id",
      "agent_fix_prompt": "Update src/foo.py on line 42 to rename the variable 'foo' to 'user_id'. This improves clarity as the variable stores a user identifier from the request object."
    }
  ]
}
Example (multiline suggested_patch): "suggested_patch": "if x:\\n    return None", "agent_fix_prompt": "In src/bar.py, add a null-check at line 20 before accessing the object to prevent a potential crash. If the object is null, return None early."
Example (no issues): {"findings": []}"""
