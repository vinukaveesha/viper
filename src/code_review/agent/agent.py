# Both FINDINGS_ONLY_INSTRUCTION (file-by-file mode, tools enabled) and

# "IMPORTANT — Line numbers" section (the intro sentence differs per mode).
_SHARED_LINE_NUMBER_RULES = """\
- Each added/context line is annotated ``<Ln>`` where ``n`` is an integer (e.g. ``<L42>``).
  Use that integer ``n`` as the ``line`` value (e.g. 42) in your findings.
  Do NOT emit the ``<Ln>`` tag itself as the line value; extract only the number.
  Do NOT compute line numbers yourself from the hunk headers.
- Only report findings for lines that have a ``<Ln>`` annotation (added ``+``
  or context `` `` lines). Never report a finding for a removed ``-`` line.
- If the exact line containing the issue has no ``<Ln>`` annotation, drop the
  finding entirely. Do NOT shift it to the nearest annotated line."""

# Output format + finding schema + anchor + placement rules.
_SHARED_FORMAT_AND_PLACEMENT = """\
CRITICAL — Output format: Your final response must be a valid JSON array that can be parsed by code.
- If you find one or more issues: output a JSON array of finding objects.
- If you find zero issues: output exactly [] (an empty JSON array).
- You may output the array as raw JSON or inside a markdown code block (```json ... ```); both are accepted.
- Do not respond with only prose (e.g. "I found no issues"); always include the JSON array so it can be parsed.

Each finding must have: path (str), line (int), severity ("high"|"medium"|"low"|"nit"),
code (str, e.g. unused-var), and message (str).
Optional fields: end_line, category (e.g. "Correctness", "Security", "Performance",
"Maintainability", "Tests", "Style"), anchor, fingerprint_hint,
suggested_patch, agent_fix_prompt.

IMPORTANT — Finding messages (decisive, no self-retraction):
- Each `message` must state one clear, actionable problem and (when helpful) the fix. Keep it short.
- Do not stream internal reasoning: no "wait / however / actually" chains, no arguing both sides,
  and no concluding that the code is fine after raising a concern in the same finding.
- If you decide there is no real issue after reasoning, omit that finding entirely from the JSON
  array. Do not emit a finding whose message retracts itself, says "false positive", or takes
  back the issue.

IMPORTANT — anchor field (strongly recommended):
- Always include an `anchor` field containing a distinctive code snippet (a substring)
  from the exact line where the issue occurs. The anchor is used by the runner to
  verify and correct the comment placement, so it MUST come from the actual code at
  the reported line number.
- Good anchors: a function call like "Files.writeString", a variable assignment like
  "viewName + \".\" +", or a method signature fragment.
- The anchor should be short but specific enough to uniquely identify the line.

CRITICAL - Placement of suggestions:
- The `line` MUST be the exact line where the issue occurs, NOT a blank line above it or a nearby line.
- If the true line for the issue or replacement is not available in the diff, you MUST completely omit the finding. Do NOT shift the `line` to the closest visible line.
- If you use `suggested_patch`, the `line` (and `end_line` if applicable) MUST exactly cover the lines that your patch replaces. If you omit `end_line`, your `suggested_patch` will replace ONLY the single `line`.
- Never attach a finding to a blank line or a preceding line if the `suggested_patch` is meant to replace the code below it. Doing so will insert duplicate code.
- Keep `suggested_patch` focused on the smallest safe, self-contained change. Do not include surrounding unchanged context."""

# Patch-note line (first sentence identical in both; FINDINGS_ONLY appends one extra).
_SHARED_PATCH_NOTE = """\
For suggested_patch (and all string fields): use \\n for newlines inside the JSON string so the
output is valid JSON; do not put literal line breaks inside string values."""

# agent_fix_prompt guidance + output examples — identical in both modes.
_SHARED_AGENT_FIX_AND_EXAMPLES = """\
agent_fix_prompt (optional) is a natural-language prompt that another AI
coding agent can use to verify and implement the fix for this specific issue.
When the issue is fixable with code changes, include a concise but complete
agent_fix_prompt that:
- Mentions the file path and line(s)
- Describes the problem and the desired fix
- Includes any relevant project-specific constraints or context

Example (one finding): [
  {
    "path": "src/foo.py",
    "line": 42,
    "severity": "medium",
    "code": "rename-variable",
    "category": "Maintainability",
    "message": "Rename variable foo to user_id for clarity.",
    "anchor": "foo = request.user_id",
    "suggested_patch": "user_id = request.user_id"
  }
]
Example (multiline suggested_patch): "suggested_patch": "if x:\\n    return None"
Example (no issues): []"""
