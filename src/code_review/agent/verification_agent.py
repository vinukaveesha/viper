"""Verification agent: second-opinion LLM pass for medium/low-confidence findings.

The main review agent stays conservative and labels uncertain findings with
confidence="medium" or confidence="low".  Rather than silently dropping them in
the refinement pipeline, this module runs a targeted verification call that
presents each flagged finding alongside the relevant code snippet and asks the
LLM to confirm or reject the concern.

Only findings with confidence "medium" or "low" are sent for verification.
High-confidence findings (and findings where confidence is None / unset) bypass
verification entirely.

_VERIFICATION_INSTRUCTION = """\
You are an expert code reviewer performing a second-opinion check on flagged findings.

For each finding you receive you will see:
- index: integer (used to match your verdict back to the finding)
- file: the source file path
- line: the line number in the new-file view
- severity: the finding severity ("high", "medium", "low", or "nit")
- message: the reviewer's concern
- evidence: brief code quote supporting the concern (may be empty)
- code_snippet: the relevant lines from the diff, with n: line-number annotations

Your task: decide whether each finding is a REAL problem visible in the code snippet.

Output a JSON object {"verdicts": [...]} with one verdict per finding:
  - index: same integer as the input
  - verdict: "confirm" if the concern is real, "reject" if the code shown is fine
  - reason: one concise sentence

Rules:
- "confirm" when the snippet supports or is consistent with the concern — not only when
  the snippet contains direct proof, but also when the concern is plausible given what is visible.
- "reject" when the code_snippet actively contradicts the concern, or the concern relies on
  context (e.g. an outer scope, a different file) that is entirely absent from the snippet.
- Do NOT invent concerns beyond what the message describes.
- Keep reason to one sentence.

Calibration examples:

Example — REJECT:
  message: "loop variable `i` shadows outer variable"
  code_snippet: (shows only one function, no outer scope visible)
  → verdict: "reject"
  reason: No outer scope is present in the snippet; the shadowing concern is not observable.

Example — CONFIRM:
  message: "result list is iterated after .sort() which returns None"
  code_snippet: "42: x = items.sort()\n43:  for item in x:"
  → verdict: "confirm"
  reason: code_snippet directly shows x being assigned None and then iterated.

Example — CONFIRM (uncertainty tie-break):
  message: "database connection may not be closed on exception path"
  code_snippet: (shows `conn = db.connect()` but the exception path is not visible)
  → verdict: "confirm"
  reason: Concern is plausible and the fix is low-risk; keep it for the author to review.

Example — CONFIRM (security vulnerability with partial evidence):
  message: "user input interpolated directly into SQL query — SQL injection risk"
  code_snippet: "87: query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ' + user_id"
  → verdict: "confirm"
  reason: String concatenation into a SQL query is directly visible in the snippet;
  this is a well-known injection pattern regardless of how user_id originates.

Severity weighting — adjust your confirmation bar by severity:
- high / medium: lean toward "confirm" unless the snippet clearly shows the concern is
  invalid. These findings represent real risk; prefer keeping them.
- low: "confirm" when the snippet directly supports or is consistent with the claim.
- nit: "reject" unless the snippet makes the issue unambiguous and easy to verify.

Tie-breaker — when genuinely uncertain after applying the above rules:
Prefer "confirm". A false positive that reaches the pipeline is safer than a real bug
that is silently dropped. Apply this only as a last resort, not as the default.
