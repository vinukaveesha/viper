"""Patch indentation normalization filter.

GitHub (and GitLab, Gitea, Bitbucket) 'Suggested change' blocks replace the anchored
line(s) verbatim.  For the replacement to be syntactically correct the patch must carry
the *same* leading whitespace as the original line — otherwise Python, YAML, and any
other indentation-sensitive language will break.

LLMs frequently omit leading whitespace from ``suggested_patch`` values, especially for
code that lives inside a class, function, or control-flow block.  This filter detects
that mismatch and re-prefixes each patch line with the correct indent, derived from the
actual diff line stored in the line index.

Only single-line patches and multiline patches whose first content line has zero leading
whitespace (while the actual diff line has non-zero leading whitespace) are adjusted.
Patches that already carry correct indentation (or whose indentation exceeds the actual
line — an unusual but valid case, e.g. the fix adds an extra nesting level) are left
untouched.

Strategy
--------
1. Look up the actual diff content for ``finding.line`` from the pre-built line index.
2. Measure the indent of the first non-empty line of the actual diff content
   (``actual_indent``).
3. Measure the indent of the first non-empty line of ``suggested_patch``
   (``patch_indent``).
4. If ``actual_indent`` is non-empty and ``patch_indent`` is empty (the common
   failure mode), prepend ``actual_indent`` to every line of the patch.

Edge-cases that are deliberately *not* corrected:
- ``patch_indent`` is already non-empty (assume the LLM got it right or intentionally
  changed the nesting level).
- The actual diff line has no leading whitespace (top-level code; nothing to fix).
- The patch is ``None`` or empty.
