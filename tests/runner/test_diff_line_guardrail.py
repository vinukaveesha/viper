"""Tests for the diff-line guardrail: findings outside diff hunks are filtered out.

Root cause of the inline comment bug:
  In single-shot mode the LLM receives the full multi-file diff and can report
  findings for lines that appear in the FILE but not in any diff hunk.  When such
  a line is sent to Bitbucket Cloud via the inline-comment API, the API either
  rejects it (raising an exception that causes a fallback to post_pr_summary_comment
  with the **path:line** format visible only in the Activity feed) or creates a
  non-inline comment.  File-by-file mode avoids this because the LLM only sees
  each individual file's diff and naturally reports lines within the hunks.

Fix: _diff_visible_new_lines() builds the set of visible lines; the runner uses it
to drop any finding whose line is not in that set before posting.
