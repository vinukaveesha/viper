"""Tests for _validate_suggested_patches: strips misplaced patches before posting.

This guardrail catches the common LLM error of hallucinating a suggested_patch for a
different piece of code while naming a visible line in the diff (which passes the
line-visibility guardrail). Without this check the patch would be rendered as a
suggestion block replacing the wrong code.
